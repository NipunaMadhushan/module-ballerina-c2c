// Ballerina supports generating Docker and Kubernetes artifacts from code without any additional configuration.
// This simplifies the experience of developing and deploying Ballerina code in the cloud.
// Code to cloud builds the containers and required artifacts by deriving the required values from the code.
// If you want to override the default values taken by the compiler, you can use a `Cloud.toml` file. <br/><br/>
// For more information, see [Code to Cloud Deployment](/learn/deployment/code-to-cloud).
